C++
---------------------------
High level programming language;
compiles into machine code which makes it efficient
Source code->c++ preprocessor->compiler->assembler->linker->executable
---------------------------
Lines that start with '#' are directives that are processed  by the preprocessor before compilation.
#include <iostream>
gets the header for input and output before the program compiles
