C++
---------------------------
High level programming language;
compiles into machine code which makes it efficient
Source code->c++ preprocessor->compiler->assembler->linker->executable
---------------------------
Lines that start with '#' are directives that are processed  by the preprocessor before compilation.
#include <iostream>
gets the header for input and output before the program compiles
---------------------------
Character types: 1 byte
'a'
Numerical integer types: many values
can be signed or unsigned to determine if they can be negative or not
1
Floating-point types: many values
use decimals
1.23
Boolean type: 
true or false
---------------------------
#define PI 3.14
replaces all usage of PI before compiling to the literal
#define NEWLINE '\n'
replaces all usage of NEWLINE with the char literal
---------------------------
Conditionl ternary operator (?)
first value is true second is false
7==5 ? 4:3
evaluates to 3 since 7 is not equal to 5
---------------------------
Explicit type casting operator
Allows for conversion from a balue of a given type to another type.
---------------------------
sizeOf returns the number of bytes a variable uses
---------------------------
OPERATORS:
:: scope qualifier
() functional forms
[] subscript
-> and . member access
new and delete allocation and deallocation
